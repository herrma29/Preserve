I never really cared for pierogi when I was a kid. The only pierogi I ever came across were found in cardboard boxes in the frozen food section of Meijer. I tried a few cheddar and potato pierogi--my sisters both loved them--but I hated cheese to begin with and was never impressed.

I went probably ten years without eating--nor thinking of--pierogies. I'm not sure from where the idea to make them first came, but sometime in 2011 my wife and I decided to give them a go.

I'm sure it had something to do with the pierogi dinner held at a church in Lansing. We drove past the sign for this dinner every day for a couple months, picturing a bunch of Polish grandmothers standing in a kitchen churning out pierogi after pierogi for hungry Lansing-ites.

No matter where the idea came from, we had the pierogi bug. We were thinking about them for a long while--their buttered and crispy exterior giving way to a soft and cheesy interior. Coupled with a dollop of sour cream and a pile of caramelized onions and you have a delicious meal.

We followed a [simple recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/pierogi-polish-dumplings/) for pierogi dough, modifying the filling a bit and have made them several times since. The pictures below show some of the process.

Lots of fun--I'd definitely recommend anyone make them. We used a ring from a wide mouth mason jar to cut out the pierogi. Be careful not to over-flour the rounds, otherwise they won't seal properly and you'll end up with floating chunks of potato in your boiling water.

Enjoy!
