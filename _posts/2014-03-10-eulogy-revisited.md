It has been just over a year since my father's life slipped away after a long fight with stomach cancer. This past year, and the year preceding it, were two of the toughest years of my life. One of them I spent separated by a great distance from my father and my home--unable to care for him or share in new memories, save for the nightly phone calls. The next year I spent hollowed out by his absence, struggling to make sense of a world without my best friend. The pain I experienced pale in comparision to the agony he endured, yet he did it with great grace.

I would give everything to erase his suffering and bring him back to this world, but because that's not an option, I will hold fiercely to the happy memories I shared with him and work every day to fill the shoes left in his absence.

While I'm sure many of the people reading this blog at the time of this post knew my father, at least in passing, I imagine a decent number never met him, nor heard the tales of his life. One of the best ways to keep our memories alive is to repeat them, and repeat them often. And so, with that in mind, I would like to share the eulogy I wrote for my father.

I have been thinking for some time about what I would say when the time came to give a eulogy for my father. How could I sum up the life of such a great man in a few minutes? How could I capture who he really was?

It felt like an impossible task; my father was many things to many people. The stories I’ve heard of his 51 years with us are filled with love and humor, good times and bad. He lived a full life, full of love and generosity, and I wanted to capture that.

I was agonizing over this seemingly daunting task when my father-in-law stumbled on a story I wrote way back in high school. It was for my 11th grade English class, and it was about a fishing trip I took with my father in Florida when I was a boy of 4 or 5. When I re-read that story, I realized I had no hope of telling the tale of my father’s life--he was too great a man to condense down to a few minutes. The best I could hope for was to share a bit of my experience with him, tell a tale told through the words of a kid who loved, and still loves, his father for all he was.

It was a warm summer night. The smell of the ocean was heavy in the air. My dad and I began our trek across the neighbor's lawn, dodging glances out of the windows of lit up houses. We walked down across the beach, the sand still warm from the beating sun of the day. We came up to the dock, its old planks worn from the sea salt and humid air. It was here that we set up shop.

My dad set his pole down and grabbed the bucket of shrimp. I was used to fishing with worms and lures in the cold lakes and rivers of Michigan. I watched him as he pushed the little guy onto my hook. I was learning the tricks of the trade. He handed me the pole and I waited anxiously for him to load up his line. We both cast out at the same time. The moon was shimmering over the waves as they broke under the dock into a light mist that carried to our noses. This was living.

A few minutes later, as we stood there, a loud crash came from beneath our feet. I ran to the side of the dock and looked down. Through the crystal water, a shiny back broke through. I saw the fin of an animal flash in the depths, then disappear. My heart was beating, I had just seen a dolphin up close for the first time.

After a while, my heart calmed down and my dad and I were back to fishing. I could see my bobber bouncing on the shiny hills forming a few yards away in the dark sea. I was concentrating hard on that bobber and then, in a quick flash, it was gone. My pole suddenly jumped, then I jumped. I could hear the quick buzz of my line being pulled out to sea. The tip of my pole was bent as far as it could go, it was a wonder it didn't snap right then. I looked down and saw my feet inching slowly towards the wet bath that lay below the dock.

It was then that I realized this was a battle I couldn't win by myself. I called in backup. My dad threw down his pole and came running over. He grabbed my shirt just as my feet slipped off the edge. There I was, dangling midair in a full out battle between my dad and the fish hardened to wars like this. My dad pulled hard and returned my feet to the comfort of the wooden dock. I cranked hard, the fish tugged harder. This fight felt like it lasted a lifetime. I was caught in the moment. I spun the reel as fast as I could and with as much strength as I could muster.

My dad stood behind me, holding my shoulder to keep me steady. Slowly, I saw the thin line creep toward me. I was winning. With one final attempt, the fish leapt from the ocean in a storm of seawater, his scales glowing in the moonlight. I cranked harder than ever, my dad ran for the net. I held on tight to the pole and looked out over the water at my catch. The fish that was dangling there was nearly as big as me. The full length of its wet body thrashing around. He knew it was over. My dad netted my enemy and placed him on the deck. 


It was then that I realized how powerful fishing was and how much I respected my dad. I've held on to those beliefs to this day.

As you probably guessed, I may have embellished a few details…it is a fishing story after all, but I think it captures who my father was, at least for me: a fellow adventurer, a great friend, a generous teacher. Someone I could count on to help me fight the difficult battles in life, to keep me grounded. Someone to share in victories with and celebrate the bounty of life. He was a man better than most, who radiated love and happiness. He was the best father a kid could ever ask for. He was my father, my best friend. I will forever carry him with me…listening to his lessons, both spoken and unspoken. Learning to be more like him every day.

I will miss you, dude. You were the best friend and best father I could ever ask for.
