<h2 id="who_i_am_and_how_i_do">Who I am and how I do.</h2>

<p>I started this website to serve as a platform for my musings and projects. I built the site using <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>–an open-sourced, <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/‎
">ruby</a>-based static site generator served on <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a> Pages with a <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> frontend. I have enjoyed learning the many bits and pieces of the framework and hope to share the unique solutions I have come across while building this site.</p>

<p>Apart from developing this website, my background and interests are all over the place, though with a strong focus on local food systems. Some of my favorite accomplishments/experiences to date include:</p>

<ul>
