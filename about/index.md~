##Who I am and how I do.
I started this website to serve as a platform for my musings and projects. I built the site using [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com)--an open-sourced, [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/‎
)-based static site generator served on [GitHub](http://www.github.com) Pages with a [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) frontend. I have enjoyed learning the many bits and pieces of the framework and hope to share the unique solutions I have come across while building this site.

Apart from developing this website, my background and interests are all over the place, though with a strong focus on local food systems. Some of my favorite accomplishments/experiences to date include:

* Working on farms and touring the western United States for six months with my wife--we've been together since 2009 and married since 2012 :)

   We worked on 6 farms in Utah ([Hell's Backbone Grill](http://hellsbackbonegrill.com/)), California ([Soil Born Farm](https://www.soilborn.org/‎) & [Omi's Farm](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Omis-Farm/138108209542101)), Oregon ([Sweet Water Farm](http://www.sweetwaterfarmhugo.com/)), and Washington ([Willow Grove Gardens](http://www.localharvest.org/willow-grove-gardens-M22195) and [Little Rascals Farm & Hansville Creamery](http://www.littlerascalsfarm.com/)); visited 14 national parks; and [blogged](http://chris-and-carrie.blogspot.com/) about the whole experience.
* Helping a few friends fulfill their dreams and open [Fork in the Road; Local Artisan Diner](https://www.facebook.com/ForkintheRoadArtisanDiner) in Lansing, Michigan.

   We grew the restaurant into Lansing's best new restaurant by popular vote, installed a <a  data-toggle="modal" data-target="#1" href='#'>kichass garden</a>, and commissioned a <a  data-toggle="modal" data-target="#2" href='#'>beautiful mural</a> for the side of the building.
* Joining the the board of directors for the [Baltimore Orchard Project](http://baltimoreorchard.org).
* Working on the film crew for [Spare Rooms](http://spareroomsmovie.com/) and beginning conversations about a [documentary](/projects/documentary/) I hope to produce over the coming years.
