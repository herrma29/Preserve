#Why?  
I started this website to serve as a platform for my musings and projects. I built the site using [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com), an open-sourced, ruby-based static site generator. I have enjoyed learning the many bits and pieces of the framework and hope to share some of the unique solutions to problems I have come across with the website in the future.

My background is all over the place, but some of my favorite accomplishments to date include:

* Working on farms and touring the western United States for six months with my _now_ wife--we've been together since 2009 and married since 2012.
* helping a few friends open [Fork in the Road; Local Artisan Diner](https://www.facebook.com/ForkintheRoadArtisanDiner) in Lansing, MI and building a garden on site.
